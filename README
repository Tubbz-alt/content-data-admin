This is a prototype to test the filters and how users react if on submit no values are preserved.

This version does NOT prefill the user's choice of date range, org, document or search terms.

To implement this properly we would need to remove/refactor the code that was added to preserve states,
and tidy up the inline CSS on the horizontal rule on the form.

We also need to consider the tests as for ease this prototype has skipped a bunch where the stubbing
needs further attention.
