description: "The chart component presents a data chart and a tabular version of the same data"
part_of_admin_layout: true
body: |
  This component takes a single set of data and presents it in a line graph and a table with one or more rows and lines.
  At mobile width the two are presented sequentially, and on wider screens they are presented in tabs the user can switch
  between. The chart relies chartkick and renders using javascript, so the table is provided as a fallback for a lack of javascript,
  an accessible view on the data for screenreaders, and a simple view of the raw data for all users.
